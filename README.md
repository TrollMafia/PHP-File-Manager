# PHP-File-Manager

This was made for the college level php project.
It has all the functions a file manager can offer.

Functions you can perform : 
   1. Add or Delete files
   2. Add or Delete folders
   3. Transfer files from Root to Folder
   4. Transfer files from Folder to another created Folder

To use this just insert the commands from the database.sql and create a folder naming:'files'.
The uploaded files will be stored in this folder only.

This was made as a College project.
